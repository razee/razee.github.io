title: Childhood toys

I just read a post about [The hardest computer game of all time](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/01/robot_odyssey_the_hardest_computer_game_of_all_time.html) and it got me thinking. Nowadays kids are not challenged, motivated, pushed forwards. Most of them are being patronised by their parents, wrapped in protective shell, letting their brain rot with their fancy pants new phone/tablet, playing stupid games. They should play with something that makes them go "wtf, how do I solve/play this". 

When remembering my childhood gaming experiences, every single game had the difficulty perma-set at hard, if not near-impossible. There was no "easy" setting, normal meant hard, hard meant impossible. Your brain and fingers curled when playing, you cursed the screen, you were getting sodomised by the developers miles away. And you loved it.

Recently I was going through old boxes and I found a kit that I played with when I was little. It includes all sorts of accessories to make your own generator, electric circuits, random gadgets that include magnets and whatnot. They weren't all that complicated, you went through the "manual" and learned everything a kid need to learn about... well stuff. That box is one of the brighest memories of my childhood, and I did not go to become an engineer just because I tinkered with generators and electricity, but it did help my brain (or so I would like to believe).

This lack of good toys/games in turn gives manufacturers/developers a reason to produce more shitty games and toys for the hungry consumers to feast on, instead of working on some innovative and brain-stimulating games.
